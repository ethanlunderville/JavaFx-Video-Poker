# JavaFx-Video-Poker

JavaFx GUI implementation of Video Poker card game.

This is an extension of one of my school projects where I was tasked to write a terminal version of the game.

Directions:

1. Place your bet.

2. Click on the cards you would like to keep in your final deck.

3. If the resulting hand is one of the winning hands, your bet will be
multiplied by a given amount corresponding to it's respective number 
on the payout table and add to the balance.
